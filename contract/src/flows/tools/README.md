# Contract deployment and end-to-end testing tools

These tools are an attempt to mix testing in the style of the [makeWalletFactoryDriver][1] API in ava with experience from testing on live blockchains in [a3p](https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-3-proposals). _See also [testing API to extend ava functional tests to end-to-end context #8963](https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/issues/8963)._

`deploy-contract.js` in the `contract/scripts` directory makes them available as a CLI tool.
